# decoder-only_gpt_pretrain
Building a decoder-only GPT transformer following tutorials

Following the tutorial at brunomaga.github.io/GPT-lite to build a decoder-only GPT transformer and pretrain on various datasets.
None of the work is my own other than trivial changes/slight variations of the code.
Work in progress.
