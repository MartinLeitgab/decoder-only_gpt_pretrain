Building a transformer model from scratch

This is an attempt to implement the descriptions in https://medium.com/@alejandro.itoaramendia/attention-is-all-you-need-a-complete-guide-to-transformers-8670a3f09d02#66d2 into a working but yet simplistic transformer. Bonus points for training on data and obtaining predictions that are better than the untrained/randomly initialized model.

A more detailed description of the project and the rules I followed will be shared in a post on LessWrong or similar.
